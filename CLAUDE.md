# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

TaskBridge (branded as "Trudify") is a Bulgarian freelance platform that connects customers with verified professionals for various services. It's a full-stack TypeScript application built with Next.js App Router.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Backend**: Next.js API Routes + Supabase
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (with pgvector for semantic search)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth (Google, Facebook, Phone)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage (images, documents, avatars)
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime (WebSocket subscriptions)
- **UI Components**:
  - **Radix UI** (via shadcn/ui) - Headless, accessible components
  - **NextUI** - Modern React UI library with beautiful components
  - Both libraries work together, use NextUI for new components and keep Radix for existing ones
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Routing**: Next.js App Router
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query)
- **Internationalization**: Smart multilingual routing with i18next
  - **URL Structure**: `/en/`, `/bg/`, `/ru/` for SEO-friendly locales
  - **Smart Detection**: Cookie preference → Browser language → English default
  - **Cost-Optimized**: Middleware with early returns (minimal execution for returning users)
- **Animations**: Framer Motion (included with NextUI)
- **Deployment**: Vercel with Supabase integration

## Key Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev             # Start Next.js development server

# Building
npm run build           # Build Next.js application for production
npm run start           # Start production server
npm run lint            # Run ESLint
npm run type-check      # Run TypeScript type checking

# Database (Supabase)
# See /docs/infrastructure/supabase-vercel-setup.md for setup instructions
# Database migrations managed via Supabase Dashboard or CLI
```

## Development Workflow

**IMPORTANT: Do NOT run `npm run build` after making changes**

- ❌ **NEVER** run `npm run build` automatically after code changes
- ❌ Running builds breaks the local development server
- ✅ The user has `npm run dev` running - changes are hot-reloaded automatically
- ✅ TypeScript errors will show in the terminal and browser during development
- ✅ Only run builds if explicitly requested by the user

**Rationale:**
- Next.js dev server provides instant feedback with hot reload
- Production builds are slow and interrupt the development flow
- Running builds kills the local server and disrupts the user's workflow
- TypeScript type checking happens automatically in the IDE and dev server

## Architecture

### Clean `/src/` Directory Structure
TaskBridge follows a modern `/src/` structure for better organization and scalability:

```
/src/
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router with multilingual routing
│   ├── page.tsx           # Root redirect to locale

```

### Architecture Benefits
- **🎯 Feature Cohesion** - Each business domain (professionals, tasks, etc.) is self-contained
- **🧩 Clear Component Hierarchy** - UI primitives → Shared components → Feature-specific components
- **📦 Clean Imports** - Barrel exports enable simple import patterns
- **🔧 Separation of Concerns** - Global utilities separate from feature-specific logic
- **⚡ Next.js Compatibility** - Full support for App Router with `/src/` directory

### Database Architecture (Supabase PostgreSQL)

**Infrastructure**: Supabase-hosted PostgreSQL with Row Level Security (RLS)

The application has seven main tables:
- **users** - Customer and professional profiles with verification fields
- **tasks** - Service requests with location, budget, and status tracking
- **applications** - Professional bids on tasks
- **reviews** - Bidirectional rating system
- **messages** - Task-specific communication between users
- **notifications** - User notification system
- **safety_reports** - User safety reporting and moderation

**Key Features**:
- User verification (phone, email, VAT number via Supabase Auth)
- Task categorization with Bulgarian service categories
- Location-based matching (city/neighborhood + PostGIS for future features)
- Professional portfolio and rating systems
- Real-time updates via Supabase Realtime
- Row Level Security (RLS) for data privacy
- File storage via Supabase Storage (avatars, task images, documents)

**Database Schema Documentation**: See `/docs/infrastructure/supabase-vercel-setup.md` for complete schema, RLS policies, and setup instructions.

### Feature-Based Architecture
Each business domain is organized as a self-contained feature with all related code co-located:

#### **Feature Structure**
```
/src/features/[feature]/
├── components/         # Feature-specific UI components
├── lib/               # Feature data, types, and utilities  
├── hooks/             # Feature-specific custom hooks (optional)
└── index.ts           # Barrel exports for clean imports
```

#### **Current Features**
- **professionals** - Complete professionals feature (listings, filtering, cards, data)
- **tasks** - Task details, actions, gallery, and activity management *(to be migrated)*
- **browse-tasks** - Task browsing and search functionality *(to be migrated)*

#### **Migration Benefits**
- **🎯 Complete Feature Isolation** - All feature code lives together
- **📦 Barrel Exports** - Clean, simple import patterns
- **🔧 Better Maintainability** - Changes stay within feature boundaries
- **🚀 Improved Performance** - Feature-based code splitting
- **👥 Team Scalability** - Different teams can own different features

#### **New Import Patterns**
```typescript
// ✅ Clean feature imports via barrel exports
import { ProfessionalsPage, ProfessionalCard } from '@/features/professionals'
import { TaskDetailPage, TaskActions } from '@/features/tasks'

// ✅ Shared components from organized directories  
import { Button, Card } from '@/components/ui'
import { Header, Footer } from '@/components/common'

// ✅ Global utilities and constants
import { formatDate } from '@/lib/utils'
import { SUPPORTED_LOCALES } from '@/lib/constants/locales'
```

## Development Notes

### Task Management Workflow
TaskBridge uses a structured approach to manage development tasks:

**📋 Task Organization:**
- `todo_tasks/` - Contains markdown files for tasks to be completed
- `complete_tasks/` - Contains completed task files moved from todo_tasks

**🔄 Workflow Process:**
1. **Task Creation**: New tasks are described and saved as `.md` files in `todo_tasks/`
2. **Task Naming**: Use descriptive kebab-case names (e.g., `profile-page-customer-avatar-upload.md`)
3. **Task Structure**: Each task file includes:
   - Task Description and Requirements
   - Acceptance Criteria (checkboxes)
   - Technical Notes and Priority
4. **Task Completion**: When finished, move the task file from `todo_tasks/` to `complete_tasks/`

**📝 Task File Template:**
```markdown
# Task Title

## Task Description
Brief description of what needs to be done

## Requirements
- Bullet point requirements
- Keep it simple for MVP

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Specific deliverable 1
- [ ] Specific deliverable 2

## Technical Notes
Implementation notes and considerations

## Priority
Low/Medium/High
```

**Benefits:**
- Clear task tracking and progress visibility
- Documentation of decisions and requirements
- Historical record of completed work
- Easy to reference and update task scope

### Path Aliases
All paths are configured to point to the `/src/` directory:
- `@/` points to `./src/`
- `@/components/*` points to `./src/components/*`
- `@/lib/*` points to `./src/lib/*`
- `@/hooks/*` points to `./src/hooks/*`
- `@/features/*` points to `./src/features/*`

### Database & Backend Operations (Supabase)

**Infrastructure Setup**: See `/docs/infrastructure/supabase-vercel-setup.md` for complete guide

**Client Usage**:
```typescript
// Client Components (browser)
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'
const supabase = createClient()

// Server Components & API Routes
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
const supabase = await createClient()
```

**Key Operations**:
- **Queries**: Use Supabase client for type-safe database queries
- **Mutations**: All writes go through Supabase client with RLS validation
- **Auth**: Managed via Supabase Auth (Google, Facebook, Phone)
- **Storage**: File uploads via Supabase Storage buckets
- **Real-time**: Subscribe to table changes via Supabase Realtime

**Schema Management**:
- Database schema defined in Supabase Dashboard SQL Editor
- Apply migrations via Supabase CLI or Dashboard
- Generate TypeScript types: `npx supabase gen types typescript --linked > src/types/supabase.ts`

**Security**:
- Row Level Security (RLS) policies enforce data access rules
- Service role key for admin operations (server-only, keep secret!)
- Anon key for client operations (safe to expose)

### Component Development Architecture

**Updated `/src/` Component Structure:**
```
/src/
├── features/              # 🎯 Self-contained business domains
│   └── professionals/     # Complete feature with components, data, hooks
├── components/           # 🧩 Shared UI components
│   ├── ui/              # Design system primitives (shadcn/ui)
│   └── common/          # Layout components (Header, Footer, etc.)
└── app/                 # ⚡ Next.js pages and routing
```

**Component Guidelines:**
- **UI components use both Radix UI and NextUI**:
  - **Radix UI** (via shadcn/ui): Base components in `/src/components/ui/` - Dialog, Select, Form fields
  - **NextUI**: Modern components - Card, Button, Input - beautiful out-of-box
  - Both work together seamlessly with Tailwind CSS
- **NextUI theming**: Configured in `tailwind.config.ts` with custom primary/secondary colors
- **Animation**: NextUI includes Framer Motion for smooth animations
- **Feature Components**: Feature-specific UI lives in `/src/features/[feature]/components/`

### NextUI Integration
- **Provider**: Wrapped in `NextUIProvider` in `/app/providers.tsx`
- **Theme colors**: 
  - Primary: `#0066CC` (blue)
  - Secondary: `#00A86B` (green)
- **Available components**: Card, Button, Input, Modal, Navbar, etc.
- **Usage pattern**: Import from `@nextui-org/react`

### Component Migration Strategy
**✅ Migrated to NextUI:**
- **Header/Navbar** - Uses NextUI Navbar with responsive mobile menu
- **TaskCard** - Uses NextUI Card, Image, Chip, Avatar, and Button components
- **CategoryCard** - Uses NextUI Card with press interactions
- **LanguageSwitcher** - Uses NextUI Dropdown with selection states

**⚠️ Keep with Radix UI:**
- **Form components** in `/components/pages/create-task.tsx` - Complex validation
- **Browse/filter components** in `/components/pages/browse-tasks.tsx` - Complex interactions  
- **All `/components/ui/` shadcn components** - Form fields, dialogs, sheets, etc.

**📋 Migration Guidelines:**
- **Use NextUI for**: Cards, Buttons, Navigation, Simple Dropdowns, Images, Avatars, Chips
- **Keep Radix UI for**: Forms, Complex Dialogs, Data Tables, Advanced Interactions
- Both libraries work together seamlessly in the same project

### Navigation Architecture

**Design Philosophy**: Clear separation of customer and professional contexts to eliminate confusion in dual-role users.

#### Route Structure

**Customer Routes:**
- `/tasks/posted` - View and manage tasks the user created
  - Filter by status: All, Open, In Progress, Completed, Cancelled
  - View applications received on each task
  - Click through to task details and application management

**Professional Routes:**
- `/browse-tasks` - Discover and browse available tasks (existing)
- `/tasks/applications` - View all applications submitted to tasks
  - Filter by status: All, Pending, Accepted, Rejected, Withdrawn
  - Track application status and responses
  - Quick actions to view task or withdraw application
- `/tasks/work` - Manage active work and professional dashboard
  - **In Progress** (default) - Active accepted applications
  - **Pending Confirmations** - Tasks awaiting confirmation
  - **Completed** - Historical work record

#### Navigation Menu Organization

**Header User Avatar Dropdown** - Contextual sections:
```
Profile (standalone)

For Customers:
- My Posted Tasks → /tasks/posted

For Professionals:
- Browse Tasks → /browse-tasks
- My Applications → /tasks/applications
- My Work → /tasks/work

General:
- Settings
- Help
```

**Profile Page Quick Actions:**
- "My Posted Tasks" button → `/tasks/posted`
- "My Work" button → `/tasks/work`

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No confusion between customer and professional roles
- ✅ Clear URL semantics (`/tasks/posted` vs `/tasks/applications` vs `/tasks/work`)
- ✅ Each route has single, focused purpose
- ✅ Scalable for future features
- ✅ Mobile-responsive with section headers
- ✅ Full i18n support (EN/BG/RU)

**Implementation Details:**
- All pages use NextUI Tabs for filters with badge counts
- Mock data included for development
- Empty states customized for each page/filter
- Translation keys namespaced: `postedTasks.*`, `myApplications.*`, `myWork.*`
- Comprehensive task documentation: `/todo_tasks/09-navigation-architecture-refactor.md`

### Task Detail Page (`/app/[lang]/tasks/[id]/`)
The task detail page features a comprehensive view of individual tasks with advanced functionality:

**🏗️ Architecture:**
- **Server Component**: Main page (`page.tsx`) handles data fetching and SEO optimization
- **Client Component**: `task-detail-content.tsx` handles translations and interactivity
- **Modular Components**: Split into focused, reusable components

**🔐 Privacy & Authentication Features:**
- **Privacy Toggle**: (`privacy-toggle.tsx`) - Automatically hides sensitive client information for non-authenticated users
- **Authentication Slide-over**: (`auth-slide-over.tsx`) - Portal-based slide-over with Google/Facebook login options
- **Mock Authentication**: (`/hooks/use-auth.ts`) - Development-ready auth system for testing

**🎯 Key Components:**
- **TaskGallery**: Image carousel with navigation
- **TaskActions**: Apply/Question buttons with authentication flow
- **PrivacyToggle**: Client information with conditional visibility
- **TaskActivity**: (Hidden) - Applications and questions management for task authors

**💬 TaskActivity Component (Author-Only):**
- **Purpose**: Allows task creators to manage applications and respond to questions
- **Features**: Tabbed interface for Applications/Questions, Accept/Reject functionality, messaging system
- **Status**: Currently hidden - requires proper author verification logic
- **Location**: `/app/[lang]/tasks/[id]/components/task-activity.tsx`
- **Mock Data**: Includes sample applications and questions for development

**🌐 Internationalization:**
- Full i18n support across all components (EN/BG/RU)
- Server-side rendering maintained for SEO benefits
- Dynamic content properly translated

### Internationalization
- **Smart multilingual routing** with URL-based locales (`/en/`, `/bg/`, `/ru/`)
- **Production-ready middleware** with cost optimization and early returns
- **Type-safe utilities** in `/lib/utils/` for locale detection and URL manipulation
- **User preference persistence** via cookies and localStorage
- **Error boundaries** and graceful fallbacks for i18n initialization
- **Modular translation resources** - Separated language files for better maintainability

#### Translation Resources Structure (Modular Chunks)
```
/src/lib/intl/
├── config.ts          # i18n configuration and initialization
├── types.ts           # TypeScript type definitions for translations
├── validate-translations.ts  # Validation script (npm run validate:translations)
├── en/                # English translations (1,203 keys total)
│   ├── index.ts       # Barrel export combining all chunks
│   ├── common.ts      # ~52 keys - Common UI terms, messages, locations
│   ├── navigation.ts  # ~31 keys - Nav menu, header, footer
│   ├── landing.ts     # ~124 keys - Landing page content
│   ├── tasks.ts       # ~190 keys - Browse, create, task cards
│   ├── professionals.ts  # ~129 keys - Professional listings & profiles
│   ├── applications.ts   # ~163 keys - Application management
│   ├── profile.ts     # ~166 keys - User profiles & settings
│   ├── categories.ts  # ~245 keys - 26 main + 135 subcategories
│   ├── auth.ts        # ~30 keys - Authentication
│   ├── task-completion.ts  # ~72 keys - Task status & completion
│   └── notifications.ts    # ~68 keys - Notifications & posted tasks
├── bg/                # Bulgarian translations (same structure)
└── ru/                # Russian translations (same structure)
```

**Benefits of Chunked Structure:**
- ✅ **Reduced Token Usage** - Edit only relevant chunks instead of 1,400+ line files
- ✅ **Better Maintainability** - Easy to find and edit specific translations
- ✅ **Fewer Merge Conflicts** - Teams can work on different features simultaneously
- ✅ **Clear Organization** - Translations organized by feature/domain
- ✅ **Type Safety** - TypeScript ensures all languages have identical keys
- ✅ **Validation** - Automated script checks key consistency across languages

#### Implementation Details
- **Translation Config** (`/src/lib/intl/config.ts`) - Centralized i18next setup with modular barrel exports
- **Barrel Exports** (`/src/lib/intl/[lang]/index.ts`) - Combines all chunks into single object
- **LocaleLink Component** (`/components/locale-link.tsx`) - Automatically prefixes internal links with current locale
- **Constants** (`/lib/constants/locales.ts`) - Centralized locale configuration, no hardcoded strings
- **Middleware** (`/middleware.ts`) - Smart detection: Cookie → Browser → English default, optimized for minimal cost
- **Language Priority**: User manual selection (highest) → Browser detection → English fallback
- **Performance**: 90% of requests skip middleware via early returns for existing locale URLs

#### Working with Translations
```bash
# Validate all translations have same keys
npx tsx src/lib/intl/validate-translations.ts

# Add a new translation key
# 1. Find the appropriate chunk (e.g., tasks.ts for task-related keys)
# 2. Add the key to all 3 languages (en, bg, ru) in the same chunk
# 3. Run validation to ensure consistency
```

#### Translation Key Structure
Translation keys follow a hierarchical namespace pattern organized by chunks:
- **common.ts**: Global terms (welcome, login, save, language.*, locations.*, message.*, error.*)
- **navigation.ts**: Navigation & footer (nav.*, footer.*)
- **landing.ts**: Landing page (landing.*)
- **tasks.ts**: Task management (tasks.*, browseTasks.*, task.*, createTask.*, taskCard.*)
- **professionals.ts**: Professionals (professionals.*, professionalDetail.*)
- **applications.ts**: Applications (applications.*, myApplications.*, application.*, acceptApplication.*, rejectApplication.*)
- **profile.ts**: User profiles (profile.*)
- **categories.ts**: Service categories (categories.*, categoryGroups.*)
- **auth.ts**: Authentication (auth.*)
- **task-completion.ts**: Task status & completion (taskCompletion.*, taskStatus.*)
- **notifications.ts**: Notifications & detail pages (notifications.*, taskDetail.*, postedTasks.*)

### Authentication (Supabase Auth)

**Status**: Supabase Auth infrastructure configured, ready for implementation

**Available Providers**:
- **Email/Password**: Built-in (enabled by default)
- **Google OAuth**: Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
- **Facebook Login**: Configure in Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Providers
- **Phone (SMS)**: Configure with Twilio/Vonage integration

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// Client-side auth example
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/client'

const supabase = createClient()

// Sign up
await supabase.auth.signUp({ email, password })

// Sign in
await supabase.auth.signInWithPassword({ email, password })

// OAuth
await supabase.auth.signInWithOAuth({
  provider: 'google',
  options: { redirectTo: `${location.origin}/auth/callback` }
})

// Sign out
await supabase.auth.signOut()
```

**OAuth Callback**: `/app/auth/callback/route.ts` handles OAuth redirects

**Middleware**: Automatically refreshes user sessions via `/middleware.ts`

**User Context**: Access current user in Server Components:
```typescript
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'

const supabase = await createClient()
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
```

**Documentation**: See `/docs/infrastructure/supabase-client-setup.md` for auth implementation examples

### Telegram Authentication & Notifications

**Status**: ✅ Fully implemented and ready for production

TaskBridge uses Telegram as the primary authentication and notification channel, providing instant, cost-free communication with users.

#### Authentication Flow

**How it works:**
1. User clicks "Login with Telegram" in auth slide-over
2. Telegram app opens (or web widget) asking for authorization confirmation
3. User approves → Telegram returns authenticated user data
4. System verifies cryptographic hash (prevents spoofing)
5. Creates user profile in database OR signs in existing user
6. Sends instant welcome notification via Telegram bot

**Implementation:**
```typescript
// Auth verification utility
import { verifyTelegramAuth } from '@/lib/auth/telegram';

// Verify Telegram authentication data
const isValid = verifyTelegramAuth(authData, process.env.TG_BOT_TOKEN);

// Auth API route
// POST /api/auth/telegram
// Handles user creation/login and stores Telegram credentials
```

**Database Fields:**
- `telegram_id` - Telegram user ID (used for sending notifications)
- `telegram_username` - @username
- `telegram_first_name`, `telegram_last_name` - User profile data
- `telegram_photo_url` - Profile photo
- `preferred_notification_channel` - User's notification preference (telegram/email/sms/viber)

**UI Component:**
```typescript
// In auth slide-over
import TelegramLoginButton from 'react-telegram-login';

<TelegramLoginButton
  dataOnauth={handleTelegramAuth}
  botName="Trudify_bot"
  buttonSize="large"
/>
```

#### Notification System

**Cost:** 🎉 **100% FREE** - Telegram Bot API has no per-message costs

**Architecture:**
```typescript
// Service layer
import { sendTelegramNotification, sendTemplatedNotification } from '@/lib/services/telegram-notification';

// Send custom notification
await sendTelegramNotification({
  userId: user.id,
  message: '<b>Your task has an update!</b>',
  notificationType: 'task_update',
  parseMode: 'HTML'
});

// Send templated notification
await sendTemplatedNotification(
  userId,
  'applicationReceived',
  'Fix My Laptop',  // taskTitle
  'Ivan Petrov'     // professionalName
);

// Via API route (from anywhere)
await fetch('/api/notifications/telegram', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: JSON.stringify({
    userId: user.id,
    templateName: 'welcome',
    templateArgs: ['Alex']
  })
});
```

**Available Notification Templates:**
- `welcome` - New user registration
- `applicationReceived` - Professional applied to task
- `applicationAccepted` - Application accepted by customer
- `applicationRejected` - Application rejected
- `messageReceived` - New message in task chat
- `taskCompleted` - Task marked as complete
- `paymentReceived` - Payment processed

**Notification Tracking:**
All notifications are logged in `notification_logs` table with:
- Delivery status (sent/delivered/failed)
- Cost tracking (Telegram = €0)
- Error messages if failed
- Metadata (message ID, delivery time)

**Configuration:**
```bash
# Environment variables
TG_BOT_TOKEN=your_bot_token_from_botfather
TG_BOT_USERNAME=Trudify_bot

# Vercel deployment
# Add these in: Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
```

**Bot Setup:**
1. Created via @BotFather on Telegram
2. Domain configured: `task-bridge-chi.vercel.app` (production) or `trudify.bg` (custom domain)
3. Commands: `/setdomain` to configure allowed domains

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Zero cost (saves €10,000-16,000/year vs WhatsApp/Viber)
- ✅ 97% open rate within 3 minutes
- ✅ Instant delivery
- ✅ No rate limits for notifications
- ✅ Rich HTML formatting support
- ✅ Deep linking to app from notifications

**Files:**
- `/src/lib/auth/telegram.ts` - Auth verification utilities
- `/src/lib/services/telegram-notification.ts` - Notification service
- `/src/app/api/auth/telegram/route.ts` - Authentication endpoint
- `/src/app/api/notifications/telegram/route.ts` - Notification endpoint
- `/src/components/ui/auth-slide-over.tsx` - Login UI with Telegram button
- `/supabase/migrations/add_telegram_fields_to_users.sql` - Database schema

**Testing:**
```bash
# Test notification to a user
npx tsx scripts/test-telegram-notification.ts <user_id>
```

**Future Expansion:**
- WhatsApp Business API (Phase 2) - for users without Telegram
- Viber Business API (Phase 3) - if justified by usage data
- Multi-channel fallback: Telegram → Email → SMS

### API Routes

**Status**: Ready to implement with Supabase client

**Structure**: API routes in `/app/api/` directory use Supabase for data access

**Example API Route**:
```typescript
// /app/api/tasks/route.ts
import { createClient } from '@/lib/supabase/server'
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET(request: Request) {
  const supabase = await createClient()

  const { data, error } = await supabase
    .from('tasks')
    .select('*')
    .eq('status', 'open')

  if (error) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: error.message }, { status: 500 })
  }

  return NextResponse.json(data)
}
```

**Security**: RLS policies automatically enforce data access rules

### Deployment & Environment

**Platform**: Vercel with Supabase integration

**Required Environment Variables**:
```bash
# Supabase (get from https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/api)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://your-project-id.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-anon-key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your-service-role-key # Server-only!
```

**Setup**:
1. Create Supabase project at https://supabase.com/dashboard
2. Apply database schema from `/docs/infrastructure/supabase-vercel-setup.md`
3. Add environment variables to Vercel project settings
4. Deploy to Vercel - environment syncs automatically

**Optional**: Use Vercel-Supabase integration for automatic env sync

### Code Quality & Maintenance

#### TODO Comment Convention
- Use `@todo` comments to mark future refactoring tasks and technical debt
- Format: `@todo CATEGORY: Description of work needed`
- Categories: REFACTORING, MIGRATION, FEATURE, BUG, PERFORMANCE, etc.
- **Always check for `@todo` comments** when working in a file or feature
- Examples:

#### ESLint & Unused Code Policy

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Delete unused code, don't prefix with underscores**

**Rule**: When fixing ESLint `no-unused-vars` warnings, **DELETE** the unused imports, variables, or parameters. Do NOT prefix them with underscores.

**Why**:
- Unused code is dead code and should be removed
- Underscore prefixes hide the problem instead of solving it
- Clean code has no unused variables

**Exceptions** (very rare):
- Interface/type definitions that must match an external API signature
- Callback parameters required by a library but not used in implementation
- When removing would break the function signature contract

**Examples:**

```typescript
// ❌ BAD: Don't prefix with underscore
const [value, _setValue] = useState()
function handleClick(_event: Event, data: Data) { }
import { Foo, _Bar } from './module'

// ✅ GOOD: Remove the unused code entirely
const [value] = useState()  // Removed setValue
function handleClick(data: Data) { }  // Removed event param
import { Foo } from './module'  // Removed Bar import

// ✅ ACCEPTABLE (rare cases): When signature must be preserved
interface ApiCallback {
  (error: Error | null, data: Data): void  // error param required by API
}
const myCallback: ApiCallback = (_error, data) => {
  // We don't use error but API requires this signature
}
```

**Action**: When you see unused variable warnings:
1. First, check if the variable is actually needed
2. If not needed, DELETE it completely
3. If it's part of a destructure, remove it from the destructure
4. If it's an import, remove it from the import statement
5. Only if removal breaks a required signature, then use underscore prefix

#### CSS Performance Guidelines

**⚠️ CRITICAL: Avoid `backdrop-blur` in Chrome**

**Issue**: The CSS `backdrop-blur` property causes severe visual flickering and performance issues in Chrome/Chromium browsers, especially on:
- Modal overlays and dialogs
- Slide-over panels and drawers
- Dropdown menus with transparent backgrounds
- Any animated or transitioning elements

**Symptoms**:
- Content behind blur flickers during animations
- White flashes when modals open/close
- Janky scrolling with blurred backgrounds
- Inconsistent rendering across Chrome versions

**Solution**:
- **NEVER use `backdrop-blur` unless absolutely critical for design**
- Use solid background colors with opacity instead: `bg-black/80` or `bg-white/95`
- If blur is required, test extensively in Chrome and provide fallbacks
- Consider using `will-change: transform` for performance hints
- Document any `backdrop-blur` usage with performance justification

**Example - Bad**:
```css
/* ❌ Causes flickering in Chrome */
.modal-overlay {
  backdrop-filter: blur(8px);
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

**Example - Good**:
```css
/* ✅ Smooth and performant */
.modal-overlay {
  background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.8);  /* Solid opacity, no blur */
}
```

**Related Components with Issues**:
- Notification center slide-over (removed `backdrop-blur-sm`)
- Modal dialogs (using solid backgrounds)
- Authentication slide-over (solid backgrounds recommended)

**Testing Checklist**:
- [ ] Test all modals/overlays in Chrome (not just Safari/Firefox)
- [ ] Verify smooth open/close animations without flicker
- [ ] Check background elements don't flash white
- [ ] Ensure mobile Chrome performance is acceptable
