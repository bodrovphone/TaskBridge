# Improve Telegram Connection Visibility in Profile

## Task Description
Move the Telegram connection settings from being buried in the Settings modal to a more prominent, visible location on the profile page.

## Current Issue
- Telegram connection option is hidden inside Profile → Settings button → Modal opens → Telegram section at top
- Users won't discover this important feature easily
- 3 clicks to reach it

## Proposed Solution
Add a prominent "Telegram Notifications" card directly on the profile page, visible without opening any modals.

## Suggested Locations (Pick One)
1. **Below Profile Header Card** - Most visible, appears immediately when profile loads
2. **As a Tab in Profile Tabs** - Add "Notifications" tab alongside "Customer" and "Professional"
3. **In Quick Actions Section** - Add button next to "My Posted Tasks" and "My Work"

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Telegram connection status visible without clicking Settings
- [ ] "Connect Telegram" button accessible in ≤2 clicks
- [ ] Connection status shows clearly (Connected ✅ / Not Connected)
- [ ] Works on mobile (responsive design)
- [ ] Maintains all existing functionality

## Design Considerations
- Should be visually prominent (benefits users greatly)
- Show connection status clearly
- Keep the benefits list visible to encourage adoption
- Match existing profile page design style

## Priority
**Medium** - UX improvement, not blocking functionality

## Estimated Effort
2-3 hours
