## Task Description
Only 15 pages are currently indexed by Google. Many high-value BG pages are missing. Manually request indexing via Google Search Console > URL Inspection > "Request Indexing" for the most impactful pages.

## Priority URLs to Force-Index

### Batch 1 - Highest Impact (do NOW)

- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg` - **BG homepage** (primary market, NOT indexed!)
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/categories` - **Category listing** (targets "услуги България" queries, links to all service types)
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/hamali-burgas-ceni` - **Blog: Movers Burgas** (local SEO, existing article not yet indexed)
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/pochistvane-apartament-ceni` - **Blog: Cleaning prices** (new Tier 1 article, high search volume keyword)
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/premествane-ceni-bulgaria` - **Blog: Moving prices** (new Tier 1 article, completes Tier 1 milestone)

### Batch 2 - Secondary (do after Batch 1)

- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/nameri-majstor-lesno` - Blog article
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/for-professionals` - Attracts professional sign-ups
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/about` - Trust signal for brand queries
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/faq` - FAQ schema, long-tail queries
- [ ] `https://trudify.com/bg/testimonials` - Social proof

## How To
1. Go to [Google Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console)
2. Select trudify.com property
3. Paste each URL in the top search bar (URL Inspection)
4. Click **"Request Indexing"**
5. Repeat for each URL (there's a daily limit of ~10-12 requests)

## Notes
- Google typically indexes requested URLs within 1-3 days
- Focus on BG locale first (primary market), EN/RU can wait
- After indexing, verify with `site:trudify.com/bg/pochistvane-apartament-ceni` in Google
- The sitemap already includes all these URLs, but manual requests speed things up significantly

## Priority
High - Direct impact on organic traffic and SEO visibility
